# ALX Shell Project

Welcome to my ALX Shell Project!

This repo contains scripts I’ve written as part of my ALX program. 

## Tasks

- **0-iam_betty**: A script to switch to the `betty` user.

## Requirements

- The `betty` user must exist on your system.

Just clone the repo, run the script, and you’re good to go!
